### Key Takeaways for Future Problems:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. **Sum of First \( t \) Natural Numbers**:  
   The sum \( 1 + 2 + \dots + t \) can be represented as \( \frac{t(t+1)}{2} \). This is useful when checking if a specific position \( X \) can be reached in a certain number of steps.

2. **Position Reachability**:  
   If the sum of the first \( t \) numbers is less than \( X \), you cannot reach \( X \) by time \( t \). If the sum is greater than or equal to \( X \), it is possible to reach \( X \) using a specific strategy (choosing a subset of jumps).

3. **Subset Strategy**:  
   By selecting a subset of steps that sum to \( X \), you can jump only on those steps and stay still otherwise to reach position \( X \).

4. **Finding Minimum \( t \)**:  
   The smallest \( t \) where \( \frac{t(t+1)}{2} \geq X \) can be approximated using the formula \( \frac{-1 + \sqrt{8X+1}}{2} \). This gives an \( O(1) \) time solution.

5. **Alternative Approach**:  
   If you don't want to use the formula, you can iterate over \( t \) sequentially and check whether \( \frac{t(t+1)}{2} \geq X \). This gives a time complexity of \( O(\sqrt{X}) \).

These insights are useful for problems involving jumping to specific positions in minimum steps or partitioning numbers into subsets with specific sums.
