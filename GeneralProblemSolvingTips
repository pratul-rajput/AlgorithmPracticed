2.Think of a method and try it i.e think that particular problem is solved using binary search and try to apply it on that question then you will get to know the problem can be solved
using binary search or not. This way you will not be blanck and u can try various approach on a question.
3.Get insights from constraints.
4. if you have confusion in code what to take or not, just take one valid example and write code which satisfy on that example.

just use pen and paper and code on paper with logic explaination.
6.First write logic on paper then code it.
